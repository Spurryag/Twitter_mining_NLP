#Summary: 

The purpose of this notebook is to conduct a basic twitter mining exercise and to demonstrate how to apply exploration techniques and machine learning algorithms for NLP . To do so, the notebook will first resort to the use of the twitter API to mine selected tweets, based on certain queries, before moving to explore the collected data and apply machine learning algorithms.

#Objectives:

* Crawl X tweets of N active politicians
* Create a classifier to assign tweets to politicians
* Investigate which politicians are similar to each other
